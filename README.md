# ALT-FISH
Scripts for automated analysis of ALT-FISH microscopy data with or without additional co-staining (e.g, cytoplasm marker, immunolabeling).
The scripts require 16-bit .TIF image z-stacks with at least 2 (and maximum 4) channels as input.

## Telosegment toolkit: What does the script do?




* optimal focus volume identification for automated removal of empty frames and out-of-focus positions 
* data reduction by z-projection for subsequent 2D segmentation procedures
* 
* segmentation of cell nuclei (comprising adjustable size-filter)
* segmentation of spots within the segmented nuclear area
* quantification of:
  * whole image intensity parameters 
  * size, xy-position and shape parameters for the generated nuclei and spot masks
  * mask fluorescence intensity parameters in up to 4 channels (mean, median, maximum, standard deviation, etc.)



* customizable batch processing
