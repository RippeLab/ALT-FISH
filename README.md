# ALT-FISH
Collection of scripts to analyze ALT-FISH stained microscopy data.

# Script 1: Telosegment toolkit
* simple segmentation of nuclei
* segmentation of spots within the segmented nuclei
* quantification of:
  * size, xy-position and shape parameters for the generated nuclei and spot masks
  * intensity parameters in up to 4 channels (mean, median, standard deviation of
